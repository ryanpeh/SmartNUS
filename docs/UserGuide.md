## 1. Introduction

SmartNUS is a **desktop app for students to revise for their exams, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). SmartNUS allows you to create a question bank and
quiz yourself, as well as add notes for revision. If you can type fast, SmartNUS can make your review
sessions more effective and faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested in using our app? Check out the [Quick Start section](#3-quick-start) to get started!

## 2. About

This section will provide you with the details on how to navigate and interpret the user guide. This guide includes all the features the app provides, with in-depth explanations and examples on how to use them.

### 2.1. Using the User Guide

The user guide has been structured in a way that makes it easy for you to navigate and find what you need.

Here's a quick summary of the available sections in the user guide:

<!-- TODO: Ensure that the numberings below are correct at the end -->
* [Section 1: Introduction](#1-introduction) - Introduction to SmartNUS
* [Section 2: About](#2-about) - About SmartNUS
* [Section 3: Quick Start](#3-quick-start) - A quick start guide to get you started with using SmartNUS
* [Section 4: Features](#4-features) - Documentation of all available features SmartNus has to offer
* [Section 5: FAQ](#5-faq) - Frequently asked questions about SmartNUS
* [Section 6: Command Summary](#6-main-window-command-summary) - Summary of all available SmartNUS commands and formats

### 2.2. Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `mcq qn/QUESTION ans/ANSWER opt/OPTION1 i/IMPORTANCE`, `QUESTION`, `ANSWER`, `OPTION1`, `IMPORTANCE` is a parameter which can be used as `mcq qn/what is 1 + 1? opt/3 opt/1 opt/0 ans/2 i/1`

* Items in square brackets are optional<br>
  e.g `qn/QUESTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `qn/What is 1+1? t/math` or as `qn/What is 1+1?`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times<br>
  e.g. `opt/…​` can be used as `opt/ OPTION1`, `opt/ OPTION1 opt/ OPTION2` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `ans/ ANSWER opt/ OPTION1`, `opt/ OPTION1 ans/ ANSWER` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ans/t ans/abc`, only `ans/abc` will be taken

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`

* All commands are case-sensitive unless otherwise stated<br>
  e.g. `help` or `ans/` is acceptable, but `Help` or `Ans/` is not acceptable<br>

* Parameters *SHOULD NOT* contain any slash "/".

</div>

## 3. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer

1. Download the latest `smartnus.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/releases)

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SmartNUS app

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data<br>
   ![Ui](images/user-guide/UiMainWindow.png)

Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list question`** : Lists all questions.

   * **`tfq`**`qn/ Is 2+3 = 5? ans/T i/3` : Adds a true false question: `Is 2+3 = 5?` with answer 'true' and importance '3' to SmartNus.

   * **`delete question`**`1` : Deletes the 1st question shown in the current question list. (If the current list being shown is not the question list, enter **`list question`** to display the question list before entering the **`delete question`** `1` command)

   * **`clear`** : Deletes **all** the data in SmartNus.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for the details of each command

  * `qn/my question? k/KEYWORDOUTSIDEANSWER ans/my answer i/2` is an invalid command
  * See examples given below for valid commands to try out.
* Keywords are stored in lowercase. Specifying `k/ABC` and `k/abc` both result in "abc" being stored as the keyword. However,
  the answer will be displayed with the correct case ("ABC" and "abc" respectively)
* During a [quiz](#start-a-quiz-quiz), any answer that contains all the keywords (case-insensitive)
  in any order is considered correct (e.g. "DatAstrUcturesandalgorithms" will be a correct answer
  to a question whose keywords are "structure" and "data")
* Keywords are made up of alphanumeric characters.
  When specifying a keyword that includes non-alphanumeric characters
  (e.g. `k/"harry, !'abc@#^e,y?`), only the first valid part of the word
  (continuous string of alphanumeric characters) will be taken as the keyword i.e. "harry".

Examples:
* `saq qn/What does mRNA stand for? ans/k/messenger k/ribonucleic k/acid i/1`
* `saq qn/Who wrote The Merchant of Venice? ans/William k/Shakespeare i/2 t/literature t/classics`

  * Answer is displayed as "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".
  * During a [quiz](#start-a-quiz-quiz):
    * Correct answers include "haRRy PoTtEr", "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
      "potter harry", "harrypotter" and "wordthatincludesharryandpotter"

* Short Answer Question (SAQ): `edit 3 ans/k/powerhouse of the k/cell t/CS2100`
  sets the answer of Question 3 to powerhouse of the cell, with keywords "powerhouse" and "cell",
  and replaces all tags with CS2100 if Question 3 is an SAQ.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

If you were previously in a filtered view (e.g. after running the `find CS2100` command),
and your edited question no longer matches this filter (e.g. question title no longer contains "CS2100"),
your edited question will not be shown on-screen. To see a list of all questions,
run the `list question` command.

</div>

#### 4.1.7. Find/Search Questions: `find`

Shows a list of all questions in SmartNUS that have all the specified keywords in their titles,
at least one of the specified tags, and the importance value (if specified).

Format: `find [KEYWORDS]... [t/TAG]... [i/IMPORTANCE]`

**Parameters**
* `KEYWORDS` The specific keyword(s) to be searched
* `TAG` The specific tag(s) to be searched
* `IMPORTANCE` The importance to be searched
<div>

* **At least** one of the optional fields to find by must be specified.
* If `KEYWORDS` are specified, they must be specified before any tags and importance.
* The search is case-insensitive for both keywords and tags (e.g. `math` will match `MaTH`).
* Only full words will be matched for both keywords and tags (e.g. `CS2100` will not match `CS210`).
* The following characters `,.?!:;*"()[]{}` which are commonly used to separate words are not considered part of a word or keyword.
  Instead, they are considered as word separators similar to a space.
  * `find *("literature":,;?!)]}` returns the same result as `find literature`.
  * `find ,:;?(]` is an invalid command as it is the same as finding a blank keyword or only inputting spaces as keywords.
  * `find first? second (third...)!` is the same as `find first second third`.
* Hyphenated words are considered as one word (e.g. `find grey-box` will not return a question titled `grey box`).
* Any question that has at least one of the tags **AND** all the keywords in its title (in any order)
  **AND** the importance specified will be listed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can search for more than one tag or keyword.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

To return to the list of all questions, use the `list question` command.

</div>

Examples:
* `find load word t/CS2100 t/MIPS i/2` returns questions tagged with at least one of the tags, with importance value 2 and whose title
  includes "load" and "word" in any order.
  * e.g. A question titled "What is the load word instruction used for?" tagged with only CS2100 and with an importance value of 2 will be listed.
* `find java` returns a question titled "How do you output text to the console in Java?" but not a question titled "Javascript is commonly used in web development. True or false?" (since `java` is not a full word match for `javascript`).

#### 4.1.8. Find/Search Stats: `stat`

Shows the list of statistics by Tag for the questions attempted.

The total number of attempts and correct attempts for questions under each tag will be shown. 

Format: `stat [t/TAG]...`

**Parameters**
* `TAG` The specific tag(s) to be searched

Caveats:
* The search is case-insensitive for tags
* Only full words will be matched (e.g. `CS2100` will not match `CS210`)
* Statistics for any of the tags passed in will be shown
* If no parameters are passed in, it will show all statistics
* For questions that have multiple tags, SmartNus will count its attempts and correct attempts under all its tags.

Examples:
* `stat t/CS2100 t/MIPS` returns the overall statistics for the questions tagged with `CS2100` or `MIPS` or both.

<!-- TODO: add brief description before format to standardise format-->
#### 4.1.9. Start a Quiz: `quiz`
Format: `quiz [lim/ LIMIT] [t/TAG]... [n/INDEX...]`

**Optional Parameters**
* `lim/` positive, non-zero integer that will limit the number of questions in the quiz.
* `t/` quiz will be formed from questions with the specified tag. If such a tag does not exist, quiz will not start.
* `n/` quiz specific questions - `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed question list.
  * Multiple indexes can be entered, with a space between them. (e.g. `n/ 1 2 3`)
* If no parameters are passed, a quiz session will be created using all the questions in the question list.
* TAG can be used to filter the quiz to only give questions with the tags specified, works with limit.
* INDEX can be used to filter the quiz to only give questions with the specified question numbers. Does not work with tag or limit.
  The index **must be a positive integer** from 1 to 2147483647

* A valid index is:
  * **a positive integer** between 1 and 2147483647 (both inclusive)
  * Equal to or smaller than the number of items in the list. Eg. If a list contains 5 questions, `6` is not a valid index but `3` is.

* A valid limit is:
  * **a positive integer** between 1 and 2147483647 (both inclusive)
  * Eg. If SmartNus contains 5 questions, `6` is a valid limit but only `5` questions will be shown in the quiz.

Examples:
* `quiz lim/5 t/CS2100 t/MIPS` quiz will select questions tagged with at least one of the tags, limited to 5 questions.
* `quiz n/1 2 3` quiz will select the questions with index number 1 2 3.
