SmartNUS is a **desktop app for students to revise for their exams, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). SmartNUS allows you to create a question bank and
quiz yourself, as well as add notes for revision. If you can type fast, SmartNUS can make your review
sessions more effective and faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `mcq qn/QUESTION ans/ANSWER opt/OPTION1 i/IMPORTANCE`, `QUESTION`, `ANSWER`, `OPTION1`, `IMPORTANCE` is a parameter which can be used as `mcq qn/what is 1 + 1? opt/3 opt/1 opt/0 ans/2 i/1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `qn/QUESTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `qn/What is 1+1? t/math` or as `qn/What is 1+1?`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `/opt…​` can be used as `opt/ OPTION1`, `opt/ OPTION1 opt/ OPTION2` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `ans/ ANSWER opt/ OPTION1`, `opt/ OPTION1 ans/ ANSWER` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ans/t ans/abc`, only `ans/abc` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
