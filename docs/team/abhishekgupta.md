### Project: SmartNus

**SmartNUS** is a desktop app specifically designed for students to revise for their exams. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Note class and Note command [#54](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/54)
  * What it does: allows the user to add notes to SmartNus
  * Justification: The main functionality of the app is that it's a revision tool. A revision tool should be able to store thoughts and reminders to de-clutter and help streamline revision.
  * Highlights: This feature opens up many possibilities for expansion as the user can tag notes, and set reminders.
