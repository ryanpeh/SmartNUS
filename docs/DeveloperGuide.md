### Architecture

<img src="images/developer-guide/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete question 1`.

<img src="images/developer-guide/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/developer-guide/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/developer-guide/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `Panel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Question` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/developer-guide/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses either the `SmartNusParser` or the `QuizInputParser` class to parse the user command, depending on which window the user is currently on (i.e. Main Window or Quiz Window).
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses, `ABCCommand` or `XYZCommand`, which are placeholders for Commands created by `SmartNusParser` and `QuizInputParser` respectively e.g. `AddMcqCommand` created by `SmartNusParser` is a `XYZCommand`, while `AnswerMcqCommand` created by `QuizInputParser` is a `ABCCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a question for `AddMcqCommand`).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is then returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete question 1")` API call.

[//]: # (TODO: Update the sequence diagram below, with sequence diagrams of main and quiz window stuff)

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/developer-guide/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are some other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/developer-guide/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `LogicManager` class will determine whether the `SmartNusParser` class or the `QuizInputParser` class will be used to parse the user command.
* The selected class it will create `XYZCommandParser` or `ABCCommandParser` (`XYZ` and `ABC` are placeholders for the specific command name created by `SmartNusParser` and `QuizInputParser` respectively e.g., `AddMcqCommandParser` and `AnswerMcqCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` or `ABCCommand` object (e.g., `AddMcqCommand` or `AnswerMcqCommand`) which either `SmartNusParser` or `QuizInputParser` returns as a `Command` object.
    * All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddMcqCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
    * All `ABCCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AnswerMcqCommandParser`, `AnswerTfqCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `QuizParser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

How the `Logic` component determines which parser to use:
- The `Logic` component uses either the `SmartNusParser` or the `QuizInputParser` class to parse the user command, depending on which window the user is currently on (i.e. Main Window or Quiz Window).
- Different parsers are used due to different commands being available to the user during the quiz (i.e. the user should not be able to execute `AddMcqCommand` while in a quiz).
- The `LogicManager` class achieves this through the usage of overloaded methods, `parseCommand(String)` and `parseCommand(String, QuizManager)`, with the latter for parsing commands while in a quiz.
- This was implemented with the consideration that the `QuizInputParser` would require a `QuizManager` argument to be passed to various `ABCCommandParser` and `Command` classes to carry out the necessary various quiz functionality.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/model/Model.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Model` component:

<img src="images/developer-guide/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the smartNUS data i.e., all [`Question`](#question-class) and [`Note`](#note-class) (which are contained in `UniqueQuestionList` and `NoteList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Question` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Question>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores another list of the currently 'selected' `Question` objects for a `Quiz` as a separate _filtered_ list which is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Question>` that can be used in the Quiz UI
* stores a list of the currently 'selected' `Note` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a list of the currently 'selected' `TagStatistic` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TagStatistic>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SmartNus` model, which `Question` references. This allows `SmartNus` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Question` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/developer-guide/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

#### Question class

The `Question` class is an abstract class that stores a `Name`, `Importance`, `Statistic`, `Tag`s and `Choice`s.
A `Choice` stores a `title` String, a boolean value `isCorrect` representing if it is a correct answer to the `Question`,
and a Set of Strings representing `keywords` used for evaluating answers to Short Answer Questions.

![Question Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/QuestionClassDiagram.png)

The validity of a `Question` depends on the type of question.
Types of Questions currently supported by SmartNUS, and their conditions for validity are:
1. Multiple Choice Questions
    * Has four `Choice`s in total, exactly one of which is correct
1. True-False Questions
    * Has two `Choice`s in total, which can only be "True" and "False", exactly one of which is correct
1. Short Answer Questions
    * Has one `Choice` in total which is correct and contains at least one `keyword`

#### Note class

The `Note` class is the class that stores a text - defined as a `NoteName`. The condition for validity of notes is:
* It should not be empty.

The notes are stored in a `NoteList` that represents a list of notes in which you can add notes, delete notes, or filter notes.
Here is a class diagram of the Notes class.

![Note Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/NoteClassDiagram.png)

#### Statistic Class
The `Statistic` class is a class that keeps track of the user performance in answering the questions in a quiz.
The performance is tracked by:
* Number of attempts
* Number of correct attempts
```
performance = number of correct attempts / number of attempts
```

Here is a sequence diagram of answering a question correctly:

![Statistic Sequence Diagram](images/developer-guide/StatisticSequenceDiagram.png)

During a quiz, when a user answers a question, the `Statistic` of the `Question` is updated.
It will increment the number of attempts by 1 and also increment the number of correct attempts by 1
given that the user answered correctly. If the user does not answer correctly, the number of correct attempts does not increase.
Below is an activity diagram to show the process:

![Statistic Activity Diagram](images/developer-guide/StatisticActivityDiagram.png)

##### TagStatistic Class
The `TagStatistic` class inherits from the `Statistic` class. The `TagStatistic` class is specifically used to keep track of the statistics of each tags.

Here is the class diagram for `Statistic` and `TagStatistic`:

![Statistic and TagStatistic Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/StatisticClassDiagram.png)




#### Quiz class

The `Quiz` class is an interface that is used to manage a quiz. A `Quiz` can get the current question, go to the next question, go to the previous question, attempt to answer the question, and get the `Statistic` of the `Quiz`.

The `QuizManager` class implements the `Quiz` interface. It manages the logic behind the quiz, and is created once a quiz is started.

Each `QuizManager` class stores the following information about the quiz:
* `questions`: A list of `Question` objects for all the questions in the quiz
* `currentIndex`: The current question index the user is currently at
* `selectedChoices`: A list of `Choice` objects used to keep track of the choices that the user has entered so far
* `statistic`: A `Statistic` object used to keep track of the statistics of the quiz

![QuizManager Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/QuizManagerClassDiagram.png)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartnus/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both SmartNus data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into their corresponding objects. (`Question` and `Note` objects)
* inherits from both `SmartNusStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.smartnus.commons` package.

#### Theme Class
The `Theme` class is a class that stores the `css` file of a theme.
Currently, there are two available themes: `LightTheme` and `DarkTheme`which inherits from `Theme`:

![Theme Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/ThemeClassDiagram.png)

The `Theme` class is used by the `UI` component to update the theme and is stored in the `Model` component as a user preference.
The theme can be changed by executing the `ThemeCommand`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add question feature

#### Implementation

SmartNus deals with different question types (MCQ, TFQ, SAQ) each of which inherits from the same abstract `Question` class, as detailed in the [`Question`](#question-class) section.

Adding of questions is done through calling the `execute` method of the `AddQuestionCommand`.

The relevant classes, part of the [`Logic`](#logic-component) component, are shown in the class diagram below:

![AddQuestionCommandClassDiagramm](images/developer-guide/AddQuestionCommandClassDiagram.png)

* `AddSaqCommand`, `AddTfqCommand` and `AddMcqCommand` inherits from `AddQuestionCommand`, which inherits from the abstract `Command` class.
* `AddQuestionCommand` implements the `execute` method as required by the `Command` abstract class, which adds a question to SmartNus.
* `AddSaqCommand`, `AddTfqCommand` and `AddMcqCommand` all have the same `execute` method. (i.e. They do not override `AddQuestionCommand#execute`)
* `SmartNusParser` creates the appropriate subtype (`AddSaqCommand`, `AddTfqCommand` or `AddMcqCommand`) of `AddQuestionCommand` based on the user's input. (e.g. User tells SmartNus to add an `mcq` question, `AddMcqCommand` is created by `SmartNusParser`, the same goes for the other question types)

The sequence diagram below illustrates how a `tfq` is added to SmartNus:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the tfq Command](images/developer-guide/AddQuestionSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTfqCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


Here's how the tfq is added:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to `execute` the add tfq command (e.g. `tfq qn/ Is 1+1 = 2 ans/T i/1`), it uses a `SmartNusParser` to parse the command via the `parseCommand` method, returning a `AddTfqCommandParser`.
2. The `SmartNusParser` calls the `parse` method of `AddTfqCommandParser`, which returns a `AddTfqCommand`.
3. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of `AddTfqCommand`, which then calls the `addQuestion` method of the model to add the tfq to SmartNus.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  This applies to the other question types as well, e.g. for adding an mcq, `AddMcqCommandParser` will be returned by `SmartNusParser`, which then returns `AddMcqCommand` upon parsing the user's input.
</div>

### Find questions feature

The find questions feature allows users to search for `Question`s by three parameters: name, tags and importance.

#### Implementation
The find questions feature is implemented using `FindCommandParser`, `FindCommand` and `Predicate`s that implement the `Predicate<Question>` interface.
Given below is a class diagram of the main classes involved in the implementation of this feature.

![Find Command Class Diagram](images/developer-guide/FindClassDiagram.png)

The FindCommandParser parses the user input into predicates that the `Question`s must match to be included in the `FilteredQuestionList`.
Each condition is represented by a predicate that extends from `Predicate<Question>`. The three search parameters in the user input, name, tags and importance,
are parsed and used to create the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate` and `HasImportancePredicate` respectively.

| Predicate | Function                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
|`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` | Checks if a `Question`'s `Name` contains all the given keywords |
|`TagsContainKeywordsPredicate`| Checks if a `Question` contains at least one `Tag`s whose name matches a keywords |
|`HasImportancePredicate`| Checks if a `Question` has a particular `Importance` value |

These predicates are passed from the `FindCommandParser` to the `FindCommand`.
`FindCommand` composes these predicates into a logical AND of all predicates. When the `FindCommand` is executed,
it updates the `FilteredQuestionList` with `Question`s that match this composed predicate, and hence satisfy all the
user’s search conditions. Given below is a sequence diagram that shows the execution of a FindCommand when a user
executes `find t/CS2103T`.

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/developer-guide/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Proposed Extensions
The find feature currently only supports finding questions. It can be extended to search for both `Question`s and `Note`s.
Here is the proposed implementation of such a feature:
1. The `FindCommandParser` will take in an additional
   parameter, either "note" or "question".
2. Depending on which item the user wants to search for, the `FindCommandParser`
   will create a `FindNoteParser` or a `FindQuestionParser`.
3. The parsers will parse user inputs into either `Predicate<Note>`
   or `Predicate<Question>`, depending on the item that the user is searching for.
4. If the user is searching for `Note`s, a `FindNoteCommand` will be generated. If the user is searching for `Question`s, a `FindQuestionCommand` is created.
   The activity diagram below illustrates this implementation.

![Find Command Activity Diagram](images/developer-guide/FindActivityDiagram.png)

### Change Theme Feature
The `Theme` class is used by the `UI` component to update the theme and is stored in the `Model` component as a user preference.
The theme can be changed by executing the `ThemeCommand`.

Here is a sequence diagram when the `ThemeCommand` is executed with a given `Theme` object called `theme` inside the `ThemeCommand`. Currently the `theme` object can either be a `LightTheme` or `DarkTheme`

![Theme Sequence Diagram](images/developer-guide/ThemeSequenceDiagram.png)

Once a `Theme` is kept inside the `Model`, the `UI` component can fetch the `Theme` and render it accordingly:

![UI Theme Sequence Diagram](images/developer-guide/UiThemeSequenceDiagram.png)

The reason why a `Theme` is kept inside the `Model`'s `UserPrefs` is because it allows the current theme to be saved in the storage as a user preference.
Without saving it in the storage, the user will have to keep changing the theme every time the user opens the app.

### Quiz feature

All features related to the quiz functionality.

#### Starting a quiz

The start quiz feature allows users to start a quiz from the main window.

##### Implementation

The quiz feature is facilitated by `MainWindow`, `LogicManager`, `SmartNusParser` and `QuizCommand`. Given below is an example usage scenario of how the start quiz mechanism behaves at each step.

1. User input `quiz lim/5` from `MainWindow` class in the Ui component is passed to the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
2. `LogicManager` will then call `SmartNusParser#parserCommand()`, which will create a `QuizCommandParser`.
3. Additionally, `SmartNusParser` will then call the `QuizCommandParser#parse()` method to parse the arguments `lim/5`, which will create a `QuizCommand`.
4. `QuizCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to execute the command, which will then call `Model#updateFilteredQuizQuestionList()` to update the questions in the `Model`.
5. The `CommandResult` is then returned back to `MainWindow` which will then create a new `QuizWindow` to be displayed.

Below is the sequence diagram to show how the quiz is started.

![QuizSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/QuizSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Parsing of user input

As different commands are available to the user at the `QuizWindow` and the `MainWindow`, it is necessary to determine which commands are valid for the user to execute based on which window the user is at.

#### Answering of questions

The answering of questions feature allows users to select their desired choice for questions during a quiz.

##### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the mechanism of answering a multiple choice question behaves at each step.

1. User input `A` and the `QuizManager` object from the `QuizWindow` class in the Ui component are passed to the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
1. `LogicManager` will then call `QuizInputParser#parserCommand()`, which will create a `AnswerMcqCommandParser`.
1. Additionally, `QuizInputParser` will then call the `AnswerMcqCommandParser#parse()` method to parse the arguments `A` and the `QuizManager` object, which will create a `AnswerMcqCommand`.
1. `AnswerMcqCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to execute the command, which will then call `QuizManager#answerAndCheckAnswer()` to update choices in `QuizManager`.
1. The `CommandResult` is then returned back to `QuizWindow` which will update the Ui with the updated message and the selected choice.

Below is the sequence diagram to show how a multiple choice question is answered.

![AnswerMcqCommandSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/AnswerMcqCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Next question

The next question feature allows users to proceed to the next question during a quiz.

##### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the mechanism of proceeding to the next question behaves at each step.

1. User input `next` and the `QuizManager` object from the `QuizWindow` class in the Ui component are passed to the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
1. `LogicManager` will then call `QuizInputParser#parserCommand()`, which will create a `NextQuestionCommand`.
1. `NextQuestionCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to execute the command, which will then call `QuizManager#nextQuestion()` to update the current question index in `QuizManager`.
1. The `CommandResult` is then returned back to `QuizWindow` which will update the Ui with the updated message and question.

Below is the sequence diagram to show how the next question is shown.

![NextQuestionCommandSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/NextQuestionCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSmartNus`. It extends `SmartNus` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `smartNusStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSmartNus#commit()` — Saves the current smartNus state in its history.
* `VersionedSmartNus#undo()` — Restores the previous smartNus state from its history.
* `VersionedSmartNus#redo()` — Restores a previously undone smartNus state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSmartNus()`, `Model#undoSmartNus()` and `Model#redoSmartNus()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSmartNus` will be initialized with the initial smartNus state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single smartNus state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th question in the smartNus. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSmartNus()`, causing the modified state of the smartNus after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SmartNusStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted smartNus state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new question. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSmartNus()`, causing another modified smartNus state to be saved into the `smartNusStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSmartNus()`, so the smartNus state will not be saved into the `smartNusStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the question was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSmartNus()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous smartNus state, and restores the smartNus to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SmartNus state, then there are no previous SmartNus states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSmartNus()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoSmartNus()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the smartNus to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `smartNusStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest smartNus state, then there are no undone SmartNus states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSmartNus()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the smartNus, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSmartNus()`, `Model#undoSmartNus()` or `Model#redoSmartNus()`. Thus, the `smartNusStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSmartNus()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `smartNusStateList`, all smartNus states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/developer-guide/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/developer-guide/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire smartNus.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the question being deleted).
